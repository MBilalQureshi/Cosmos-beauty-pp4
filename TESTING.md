## Browser Testing
- The Website was tested on Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari browsers with no issues noted.
- Firefox bug fix: All three buttons on product details were attached with no margin between them, this was caused by br tags used after buttons. br tags were removed and content was moved inside divs with proper margin on top and bottoms.

## Device Testing
The Cosmos Beauty is tested accross various devices provided by Chrome devtool. Some of devices are Glaxy S3, Microsoft Lumia 950, Kindle Fre HDX, Nexus 7, Glaxy S8, Iphone SE, Iphone XR, Iphone 12, Iphone 5, Iphone 12 pro Max, Jiophone 2(smallest screen size), Surface Duo, Ipad Air, Glaxy Fold and Nest Hub.
